NAME
----
galosh-create-qsl - Create printable QSL card backs.

SYNOPSIS
--------
    galosh create-qsl [--preview]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
`galosh create-qsl` uses LaTeX to create a PDF file suitable for
printing on the back of a QSL card.  This command is primarily plumbing,
intended to be called by `galosh qsl`.  However, it can also be used to
create nicely laid-out QSL card backs from your own scripts.

USAGE
-----
    galosh create-qsl <<EOF
      [ {
          "my-cq-zone"  : 13,
          "my-itu-zone" : 71,
          "my-grid"     : "HD15sr",
          "to-call"     : "TORADIO",
          "my-call"     : "VP8DMH"
        },
        {
          "qso-date" : "26-Mar-2011",
          "time-on"  : "1840",
          "mode"     : "SSB",
          "qrg"      : "18.125",
          "his-call" : "I1HYW"
        } ]
    EOF

`galosh create-qsl` reads JSON from STDIN.  The data should be provided
as an array of hashes (or "objects", in JSON terminology).  The first
object is special, and contains metadata that apply to the card as a
whole rather than to an individual QSO.  Valid fields are shown in the
example above.  One additional field is recognized: "swl".  If this
field is set to any value, the card is taken to be a response to an SWL
report rather than confirmation of a 2-way QSO.

All objects after the first represent QSOs.  Currently only 3 fit
comfortably on a standard QSL card -- it's up to you to check this.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
qsl.printcmd::
    Specify the command to be used to print the completed card.  If this
    option exists, `galosh create-qsl` will call the specified command,
    passing it the path to a PDF file as the final word on the
    command-line.  For example:

      printcmd = lp -o media=Custom.90x140mm -o landscape

qsl.previewcmd::
    Specify the command to be used to preview the completed card.  If
    this option exists, `galosh create-qsl` will call the specified
    command, passing it the path to a PDF file as the final word on the
    command-line.  For example:

      # Linux
      previewcmd = evince

      # OS X
      previewcmd = open -W

Note that neither printcmd nor previewcmd should return until they are
done with PDF file.  As soon as the specified commands complete,
`galosh create-qsl` will clean up the generated PDF and exit.
