SYNOPSIS

using `git` to manage your Galosh repository.

By default, 'galosh difftool' will compare the working copy of your log with
HEAD -- the most recently checked-in version.

USAGE

'galosh difftool'::

    Compare the working copy of the log with HEAD.

'galosh difftool' <commit>::

    Compare the working copy of the log with <commit>.  See
