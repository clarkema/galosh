galosh-compile(1)
=================

NAME
----
galosh-compile - Compile a Galosh subcommand to increase startup speed.

SYNOPSIS
--------
`galosh compile` [<command>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
By default, Lisp-based Galosh commands are loaded from source each time
the command is run.  Your Lisp implementation probably caches compiled
versions of most of the dependencies, but this can still result in
commands being quite slow to start.  The effect is especially noticeable
with commands that make use of entity data.

To mitigate this, you can choose to compile the Galosh commands you use
most.  The process will create an executable in $HOME/.galosh/compiled,
which will be used instead of loading from source.

The advantage is a much faster load time.  The disadvantage is that the
compiled commands are quite large files, and they will need to be
recompiled if you:

. update Galosh;
. make any changes to the source yourself; or
. update entity data.
