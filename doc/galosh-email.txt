NAME
----
galosh-email - E-mail amateur radio operators by callsign

SYNOPSIS
--------
`galosh email` [<callsign>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
`galosh email` is a very thin wrapper around `galosh qrz`, which uses the
qrz.com XML API to look up another operator's e-mail address, which it then
passes to your chosen mail user agent.

For this to work, you must:

. have set up `galosh qrz` so that it works for XML API queries (i.e., online mode); and
. be connected to the Internet.

SETUP
-----
`galosh qrz` uses qrz.com as its data source for callsign lookups, so you will
need an account.  For more information on this, see the main Galosh user manual.
